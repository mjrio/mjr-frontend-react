#React + WebPack
<img src="images/webpack.png" alt="">
Webpack is part of this new generation of packager / module loader for your Javascript project. It is one of the fastest rising solutions and helps you manage your project dependencies as well as replacing most of Grunt/Gulp in building your assets into a deployable product. 

We're going to add webpack to our latest example.

Since we already installed react, let’s install all our dev dependencies. For this we’ll need webpack and webpack-dev-server for building/developing the app. We’ll need babel (which we'll use for our jsx transformation) in order to let webpack transform our jsx files into regular js files.

    npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server 
    npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader
    npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core

###Application structure
    -app
        -components
            employeeContainer.jsx
            employeeList.jsx
            addNewEmployee.jsx
        app.jsx
    -node_modules
        ...
    index.html
    webpack.config.js
    server.js
    package.json

First, well add an app folder to the root of our application. Inside this folder we'll add a new component (app.jsx). This component will be our starting point, the highest parent of our application.

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
    import EmployeeContainer from './components/employeeContainer.jsx';

    ReactDom.render(<EmployeeContainer />, document.getElementById('app'));

Second, We'll add a folder (components) which will hold our components.
Until now we defined all our components in a single file. Let's split them up:

    //employeeContainer.jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import EmployeeList from './employeeList.jsx';
    import AddEmployee from './addNewEmployee.jsx';

    export default React.createClass({
        ...
    });

-

    //employeeList.jsx
    import React from 'react';

    export default React.createClass({
        ...
    });

-

    //addNewEmployee.jsx
    import React from 'react';

    export default React.createClass({
        ...
    });

###Configuring webpack
We add the config file to the root of our folder:

    //webpack.config.js
    var webpack = require('webpack');
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      devtool: "eval", //enables debugging
      entry: [
        'webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080',
        'webpack/hot/only-dev-server', 
        './app/app.jsx'
      ],
      output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: "bundle.js",
        publicPath: '/public/'
      },
      plugins: [
        new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin() //allows instantaneous live refresh without losing state while editing React components
      ],  
      module: {
        loaders: [
          { 
            test: /\.jsx$/, 
            loaders: ['react-hot', 'babel'],
            include: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
            exclude: /node_modules/, 
          }
        ]   
      }
    };

Since we are using babel for our jsx transformation and es2015. We need to install and define these plugins:

    npm install babel-preset-react
    npm install babel-preset-es2015

    // .babelrc
    {
      "presets": ["es2015", "react"]
    }


We are going to create a server.js file in order to serve our application and enable hot reloading:

    //server.js
    var webpack = require('webpack');
    var WebpackDevServer = require('webpack-dev-server');
    var config = require('./webpack.config');

    new WebpackDevServer(webpack(config), {
      publicPath: config.output.publicPath,
      hot: true,
      historyApiFallback: true
    }).listen(8080, 'localhost', function (err, result) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }

      console.log('Listening at localhost:8080');
    });

Next we'll edit our HTML file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>React</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">
        <script src="node_modules/react/dist/react.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app" class="container"></div>

        <script src="/public/bundle.js"></script>

      </body>
    </html>

Since webpack will handle JSX tranformation we can exclude the runtime JSX transformer.

We'll now point to the bundle.js file webpack is generating for us.

Finally we add some configuration to our package.json file to start our server.js:

    "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js"
    }

Our webpack should be up and running now.

We can server our application by typing "npm start" in our console.
